# Note: custom style files can be placed centrally in the user specific directory

#+BEAMER: \setbeamercovered{transparent=30}



** Some remarks on options
   - [[info:org#Export%20settings][info:org#Export settings]]
   - The H:2 setting in the options line is important for setting the
     Beamer frame level. Headlines will become frames when their level
     is equal to =org-beamer-frame-level=.
   - ^:{} interpret abc_{subs} as subscript, but not abc_subs
   - num:t configures whether to use section numbers. If set to a number
     only headlines of this level or above will be numbered
   - ::t defines that lines starting with ":" will use fixed width font
   - |:t include tables in export
   - -:t Non-nil means interpret "\-", "--" and "---" for export.
   - f:t include footnotes
   - *:t Non-nil means interpret
     : *word*, /word/, _word_ and +word+.
   - <:t toggle inclusion of timestamps
   - timestamp:t include a document creation timestamp into the exported file
   - todo:t include exporting of todo keywords
   - d:nil do not export org heading drawers
   - tags:nil do not export headline tags

** addtional LaTeX packages

   # for generating example texts for testing
   #+BEAMER_HEADER: \usepackage{blindtext}

* Introduction
** An alternative title page for a section
   # usually I leave the heading empty (just spaces)
   # this is the only good way of making section title slides
   # I have found up to now.

** Instructions
   Look at the *Org source* file to learn about available options. I also
   added many comments explaining the usage, there.
   - generating presentation notes.
   - inserting a table of contents with the current section highlighted at
     the beginning of each section.
   - configuring transparency of yet uncovered overlay elements.

** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:
- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.
The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

   - A headline with an =ignoreheading= environment will only have its contents
     displayed in the output. The heading text itself is ignored, and no
     heading bar is shown.
     + Contents are not inserted in any =frame= environment. It makes no sense
       to use this as major element for a slide.

   - ignoreheading is useful as a structural element in order to again
     place normal text after a previous element (like a block or a
     column environment).

    - On this slide you should see that the text of the upper items is
      differently typeset from the bottom item in the /structureenv/.

* Animations by overlays
** Highlighting text

   The double =@@= can be used to enclose active code. Here we use it to specify
   beamer code that will highlight text by specifying an overlay.
   
   A *@@beamer:<2->@@useful* feature

** Lists
   For the first list we use an =#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-= specification.

   It acts like =\begin{itemize}[<+->]=. So, it will cause the
   list items to appear one after the other.

   #+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
   - item 1
   - item 2
   - item 3

   For the second list we classify each line by angular brackets to
   explicitely define the order of revealing each item.
   - <1-> item 1
   - <3-> item 2
   - <2-> item 3

** Basic revealing of blocks using BEAMER_act
